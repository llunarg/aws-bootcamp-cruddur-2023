 **1. Creation of the Admin user.**

The "admin" user has special privileges within the AWS platform. An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user is an entity that you create in AWS. The IAM user represents the human user or workload who uses the IAM user to interact with AWS. A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials. An IAM user with administrator permissions is not the same thing as the AWS account root user. You can use the AWS Management Console to create IAM users.

**See:** [Creating IAM Users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console)
